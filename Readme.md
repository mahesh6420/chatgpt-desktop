I was tired of using a browser for ChatGPT. I wanted a standalone desktop app for an easy navigation.
Since there were non, i thought of creating one myself.

So, here it is, ChatGPT Desktop 1.0.0.

You can go to ```dist``` folder and download the ```dmg``` file.

Install the dmg file on your mac and enjoy the standalone app for ChatGPT.

I hope you like it.
